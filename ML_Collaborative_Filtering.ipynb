    "\n",
    "IMDb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages. The simplest way to explain it is that although we accept and consider all votes received by users, not all votes have the same impact (or ‘weight’) on the final rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "When unusual voting activity is detected, an different weighting calculation may be applied in order to preserve the reliability of our system. To ensure our rating mechanism remains effective, we don't disclose the exact method used to generate the rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following formula is used to calculate the Top Rated 250 titles. This formula provides a true 'Bayesian estimate', which takes into account the number of votes each title has received, minimum votes required to be on the list, and the mean vote for all titles:\n",
    "\n",
    "weighted rating (WR) = (v ÷ (v+m)) × R + (m ÷ (v+m)) × C\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "R = average for the movie (mean) = (rating)\n",
    "\n",
    "v = number of votes for the movie = (votes)\n",
    "\n",
    "m = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top Rated list (currently 25,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "C = the mean vote across the whole report\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be aware that the Top Rated Movies Chart only includes theatrical features: shorts, TV movies, miniseries and documentaries are not included in the Top Rated Movies Chart. The Top Rated TV Shows Chart includes TV Series, but not TV episodes or Movies.\n",
